                <p class="newfont">Hi there! My name is Sonal. I'm an attorney with a background in chemistry. I'm a total nerd and love
                    reading, doing puzzles, and learning how to code. I received my undergraduate degree from Duke
                    University in Durham, NC and my doctorate of jurisprudence (law degree) from Vanderbilt University
                    in Nashville, TN.</p>

                <p class="newfont">When my nose isn't in a book, you can most likely find me wandering outside somewhere - either
                    hiking, running or playing frisbee. Sometimes, I like to just sit by the water and watch the birds
                    fly and the water ripple. I find it very peaceful and calming.</p>

                <p class="newfont">In the evenings, I'm usually experimenting with a random vegan recipe, seeing how I can trick myself
                    into eating as many vegetables as possible in the most delicious way! And, on the weekends after a
                    long week, I love to reward myself with a freshly popped bowl of popcorn, just doused in vegan
                    butter. YUM!</p>
